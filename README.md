# Udacity Feed Reader Testing Project

Project of Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree. A web-based application that reads RSS feeds is giving. Need to write and completed test codes using Jasmine. 
The goal is to run test-driven development and tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features.

## How to run

Download the zip folder in github, unzip it and open `index.html`.
Jasmine tests will run and show all tests results.

## Specs tests and all steps

1. Open and explore in `index.html` , `style.css` and `app.js` to understand all functions and how it works.
2. Open and explore `feedreader.js` and review the [Jasmine documentation](http://jasmine.github.io).
3. Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object has a URL defined and is not empty.
4. Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object has a name defined and is not empty.
5. Write test to ensure the toogle menu functions properly (it opens when clicked, and it closes when clicked again).
6. Write test to make sure there's at least 1 entry in `.feed` container.
7. Write test to load the new feeds.
8. Make sure no tests failling.
